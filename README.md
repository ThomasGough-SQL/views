2. **product_sales_summary_view.sql** - Summarizes sales data for each product, detailing total units sold and revenue generated.
3. **monthly_revenue_view.sql** - Aggregates revenue data on a monthly basis, facilitating trend analysis over time.

2. **Execute Scripts:** Run each SQL script in your database management system to create the views.
3. **Query the Views:** Use standard SQL `SELECT` statements to retrieve data from the newly created views.
